    <h1>Installing Node</h1>

<p>In this chapter we will be looking at the installation and compilation of node. Although there are several ways we may install node, we will be looking at <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew</a>, <a href="http://github.com/visionmedia/ndistro">nDistro</a>, and the most flexible method, of course - compiling from source.</p>

<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h3>

<p>Homebrew is a package management system for <em>OSX</em> written in Ruby, is extremely well adopted, and easy to use.  Homebrew can be installed in a number of ways.  Possibly the easiest way is to perform a quick install to <code>/usr/local/</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"</code></pre>

<p>Next, to install node via the <code>brew</code> executable, simply run:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install node.js</code></pre>

<p>For more information on packages and commands available to homebrew, checkout the README at github.</p>

<h2 id="nDistro">nDistro</h2>

<p><em>NOTE: nDistro uses pre-compiled node binaries. To use the most recent node.js release, skip to compiling by source.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/visionmedia/ndistro">nDistro</a> is a distribution toolkit for node, which allows creation and installation of node distros within seconds. An <em>nDistro</em> is simply a dotfile named <em>.ndistro</em> which defines
 module and node binary version dependencies. In the example
below we specify the node binary version <em>0.1.102</em>, as well as
several 3rd party modules.</p>

<pre><code>node 0.1.102
module senchalabs connect
module visionmedia express 1.0.0beta2
module visionmedia connect-form
module visionmedia connect-redis
module visionmedia jade
module visionmedia ejs</code></pre>

<p>Any machine that can run a shell script can install distributions, and keeps dependencies defined to a single directory structure, making it easy to maintain and deploy. nDistro uses <a href="http://github.com/visionmedia/nodes">pre-compiled node binaries</a> making them extremely fast to install, and module tarballs which are fetched from <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> via <em>wget</em> or <em>curl</em> (auto detected).</p>

<p>To get started we first need to install nDistro itself, below we <em>cd</em> to our bin directory of choice, <em>curl</em> the shell script, and pipe the response to <em>sh</em> which will install nDistro to the current directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /usr/local/bin &amp;&amp; curl http://github.com/visionmedia/ndistro/raw/master/install | sh</code></pre>

<p>Next we can place the contents of our example in <em>./.ndistro</em>, and execute <em>ndistro</em> with no arguments, prompting the program to load the config, and start installing:</p>

<pre><code>$ ndistro</code></pre>

<p>Installation of the example took less than 17 seconds on my machine, and outputs the following <em>stdout</em> indicating success. Not bad for an entire stack!</p>

<pre><code>... installing node-0.1.102-i386
... installing connect
... installing express 1.0.0beta2
... installing bin/express
... installing connect-form
... installing connect-redis
... installing jade
... installing bin/jade
... installing ejs
... installation complete</code></pre>

<h2 id="building_From_Source">Building From Source</h2>

<p>To build and install node from source, we first need to obtain the code. The first method of doing so is
via <code>git</code>, if you have git installed you can execute:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone http://github.com/ry/node.git &amp;&amp; cd node</code></pre>

<p>For those without <em>git</em>, or who prefer not to use it, we can also download the source via <em>curl</em>, <em>wget</em>, or similar:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -# http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.2.tar.gz &gt; node.tar.gz
$ tar -zxf node.tar.gz</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have the source on our machine, we can run <code>./configure</code> which discovers which libraries are available for node to utilize such as <em>OpenSSL</em> for transport security support, C and C++ compilers, etc. <code>make</code> which builds node, and finally <code>make install</code> which will install node.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code></pre>

<h2 id="installing_from_Distribution_Sources">Installing from Distribution Sources</h2>

<p>Installing node.js from a distribution's repositories is not highly recommended.  This is because the version included with your distribution may be very outdated.  As an example, the original version of this document was written to target node.js 0.1.99.  In Ubuntu 10.10, the version of node.js included in the official repository is 0.1.97-1build1.  Because node.js is a relatively young project with a large community, changes to the API occur quickly and often.</p>

<p>If you still wish to install nodejs from an official repository, it can be done in the usual way:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ yum install nodejs</code></pre>
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/sh_main.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/sh_javascript.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
	sh_highlightDocument(undefined, 'javascript', 'tt');
	sh_highlightDocument(undefined, 'javascript', 'code');
	sh_highlightDocument(undefined, 'javascript', 'pre');
  </script>
